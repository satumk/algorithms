## Purpose of this repository:

I have used specialised libraries of methods for data science and data
analysis. However, I also want to understand the funktioning of different 
algorithms better than this approach allows me to. So I am going to start 
designing my own algorithms.

I make no claim to them being better, nor is that my main intention, although
it would be a really nice bonus. However, my main focus is on learning to
code better and to understand the methods I use better.

Some algorithms are fairly straightforward, as counting mean. Others will be
less so.
